			<p class="intro">New York City, N.Y.–– Overall, <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/nypd/stats/crime-statistics/historical.page" target="_blank">major crime</a> in New York City has continued to declined since 2000. However, reports to NYPD of stolen vehicles are on the rise. As New York City gears up to implement a $15 congestion tax <a href="https://ny1.com/nyc/manhattan/transit/2023/10/02what-to-know-about-congestion-pricing-in-new-york-city" target="_blank"></a> next year for vehicles coming into Manhattan south of 60th Street, parking patterns in the city will likely change. Therefore, knowing which areas have lower rates of vehicle theft will likley come in handy to commuters next year. 
			</p>

			<p>The seven major felony offenses, according to NYPD, are murder, rape, robbery, felony assault, burglary, grand larceny, and then grand larceny of a motor vehicle. Despite an overall decrease in major crime in 2023, <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/assets/home/downloads/pdf/press-releases/2023/Grand_Larceny_009_A.pdf" target="_blank">data</a> for stolen vehicles was up approximately 18% in the first half of the year. An increase in theft of certain Kia and Hyundai models was the primary reason, which has been an issue across the United States.

			<p>Queens and the Bronx have the highest number of motor vehicle thefts. In 2022, precinct 43 in the southeast Bronx had the highest number of stolen vehicles reported. That precinct serves Westchester Avenue, Castle Hill Avenue, White Plains Road, and Parkchester.</p>

			<p>When looking at NYPD crime data, it’s important to keep in mind the data is based on crimes reported to police. However, vehicle theft data tends to be accurate, according to Christopher Herrmann, an associate professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice at City University of New York.</p>

			<p>“We know that the public does not do a great job reporting crime, even serious/felony crimes. The exception to the crime reporting issues are murder and auto theft, otherwise, we know that the majority of serious crime (according to the <a href="https://bjs.ojp.gov/data-collection/ncvs"target="_blank">National Crime Victimization Survey</a>) does not get reported to local police departments and is not reflected in official statistics,” explained Herrmann, who is also a former crime analyst supervisor with NYPD.</p>

			<p>When looking at the percent change in the number of vehicles stolen from 2021 to 2022 in New York City, the story changes.</p>
            
            <h3>How has the number of stolen vehicles changed from 2021 to 2022?</h3>

            <p><iframe title="Percent change in vehicles stolen by NYPD precinct from 2021 to 2022" aria-label="Map" id="datawrapper-chart-7Lgos" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/7Lgos/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="746" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();

			<p>The map above shows precinct 100, the southern portion of Queens on the Rockaway Peninsula, has the highest increase in the number of vehicles stolen from 2021 to 2022. Precinct 44 in the southwest Bronx saw the second highest percent change in vehicles stolen. That area serves the Grand Concourse, Bronx Terminal Market, and Yankee Stadium. As a whole, Staten Island, which is mostly residential, is seeing the highest percentage change overall, from 2021 to 2022, in the number of vehicles stolen.</p>
